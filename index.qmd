# ðŸŽ² Simulation Challenge - Monte Carlo Analysis
1. **Expected Value Analysis:** What is the "expected value" of your account balance after 1 coin flip for the original game?
## The expected value of your account balance after 1 coin flip is $1050.

2. **Expectation vs. Reality:** Is the expected value positive or negative? Do you expect your account to be worth more or less than $1,000 based on this result?
## The expected value is positive. I expect my amount to be worth more than 1000 dollars.

3. **Single Simulation:** Run one simulation showing the dynamics of your account balance over time. Make an object-oriented matplotlib OR ggplot2 plot showing your simulated account balance over time (i.e. as you age). Comment on the results, are you happy?

**Answer:** A single object-oriented matplotlib simulation was run (ages 25â€“55) starting from $1,000. The resulting figure is embedded below.

**Commentary:** The path ends at approximately $0.84 after 30 years (âˆ’99.9%), with 9 heads and 21 tails. Despite a positive expected value per flip, multiplicative compounding and volatility drag dominate typical trajectoriesâ€”this is an instance of the ergodicity problem. Am I happy? Noâ€”this outcome is catastrophic and highlights why relying on expectation alone is misleading.

4. **Multiple Simulations:** Run 100 simulations modelling the dynamics of your account balance over time. Make an object-oriented matplotlib OR ggplot2 plot showing a probability distribution of the 100 simulatedaccount balance at age 55. Comment on the results, are you happy? Why or why not?

**Answer:** 100 simulations were run using object-oriented matplotlib, showing the distribution of final account balances at age 55. The resulting figure is embedded below.

![](multiple_simulations_distribution.png){fig-cap="Distribution of final account balances from 100 simulations (ages 25â€“55) with OO matplotlib - linear scale with values >$10,000 grouped"}

**Key Results:**
- Mean final balance: $2,379
- Median final balance: $206  
- Probability of ending above $1,000: 31.0%
- Probability of ending above $10,000: 6.0%
- 43% of simulations resulted in catastrophic losses (<$100)

**Commentary:** Am I happy? Noâ€”this is deeply concerning. The linear-scale histogram with smaller buckets clearly shows the distribution's true nature: a massive concentration of catastrophic losses (red bars <$100) and moderate losses (orange bars $100-$1,000), with only a few profitable outcomes (green bars >$1,000). The 6 simulations above $10,000 are grouped together, but even this "success" represents just 6% of all paths. While the mean suggests profitability, the median reveals the harsh reality: most people lose money. This demonstrates the ergodicity problem: mathematical expectation is positive, but typical individual outcomes are devastating. The 31% success rate means 69% of people face financial ruin, highlighting why simulation is crucial for understanding real-world risk.

5. **Probability Analysis:** Based on the 100 simulations above, what is the probability that your account balance will be greater than $1,000 at age 55?

**Answer:** Based on the 100 simulations conducted above, the probability that your account balance will be greater than $1,000 at age 55 is **31.0%**.

**Detailed Analysis:**
- Out of 100 simulations, 31 ended with a balance above $1,000
- This means 69% of simulations resulted in losses relative to the initial investment
- The distribution shows that most people (69%) face financial ruin in this investment strategy
- Only about 1 in 3 people would end up better off than they started

**Interpretation:** This low probability (31%) demonstrates the high risk nature of this investment strategy. Despite having a positive expected value mathematically, the vast majority of individual outcomes are unfavorable, highlighting the critical difference between mathematical expectation and real-world individual experienceâ€”the core concept of the ergodicity problem in economics.

6. **Strategy Comparison:** Run 100 simulations for the modified game strategy shown below in @exm-ErgodicityEconomicsExampleModified. What is the probability that your account balance will be greater than $10,000 at age 55? Is this probability higher or lower than the probability in the original game?

**Answer:** 100 simulations were run for the modified strategy (betting exactly 50% of balance each round) using object-oriented matplotlib. The resulting distribution plot is embedded below.

![](modified_strategy_distribution.png){fig-cap="Distribution of final account balances from 100 simulations of modified strategy (50% betting) with OO matplotlib - linear scale with values >$10,000 grouped"}

**Modified Strategy Results:**
- Probability of ending above $10,000: **1.0%**
- Probability of ending above $1,000: **45.0%**
- Mean final balance: $2,012
- Median final balance: $1,000
- Only 1% of simulations resulted in catastrophic losses (<$100)

**Comparison with Original Strategy:**
- **P(Balance > $10,000): 1.0% vs 6.0%** â†’ **LOWER** in modified strategy
- **P(Balance > $1,000): 45.0% vs 31.0%** â†’ **HIGHER** in modified strategy

**Analysis:** The modified strategy shows a classic risk-return trade-off. The linear-scale histogram with smaller buckets clearly reveals the distribution's characteristics: most outcomes cluster around the $1,000 median (orange and green bars), with very few extreme values. The single simulation above $10,000 is grouped at the threshold, representing just 1% of all paths. By only betting 50% of the balance, it creates a "safety net" that prevents total ruin (only 1% catastrophic losses vs 43% in original) and improves the probability of staying above $1,000. However, this conservative approach severely limits upside potential, reducing the chance of reaching $10,000+ from 6% to just 1%. The strategy prioritizes capital preservation over explosive growth, demonstrating how position sizing fundamentally changes risk-return characteristics.
